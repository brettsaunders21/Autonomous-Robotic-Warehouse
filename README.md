# rp-team1.1

All code for all different roles shall be stored here.

## Basic Usage Rules
 - Don't push any binary or IDE files! Don't push rp-pc, rp-shared or rp-utils projects!
 - Use log4j in all of the code you write
 - Include javadocs and basic comments as you go along

## Getting Started
1. Clone repository to eclipse or editor
2. Create new branch for your part of assignment (best to use the name of the role you are working on as branch name)
3. Write all of your code on that branch
4. When you wish to commit, only commit to your branch

## Merging with master
1. Make sure you code works, test it as much as possible first
2. Commit and Push changes to your branch
3. Create merge request with Branch Integration
4. Integration team with then combined this code into the master branch. This will require communication between you and them, there is a integration team channel. Please message on that.

It is important that code in the master branch is only code that is well tested and should work fully. Though we need to test that code works together, so don't be afraid if you reach a milestone to integrate your code.
